## The Subnet DAO
The Subnet DAO is an organization that governs the development of the Subnet community and project. If you are interested in contributing to the Subnet project and feel you are aligned with the project values, then we welcome you to join it. To lean more about the Subnet DAO and to consider joining it, please join the [Subnet DOA Discord](https://discord.gg/SBUd85xNf9).

## Subnet DAO Genesis NFT
We are working on a free limited edition gnesis NFT to be given as a welcome present to all new Subnet DAO members.

## The Subnet Company
The Subnet private company is a development company set up to oversea development of the project until first platform public launch. The company will issue equity to accredited investors and investors will purchase rights for $SUB coins at genesis time as part of their investment in the company.

## Project Funding
Subnet is an ambitious and complex software project. It requires strong core developers. The project has been self-funded by its founders. Additional funding will be provided by the Subnet Company. No public sale is planned for $SUB coins. We actively explore ways to enable different kinds of investors, small and large, to be able to legally invest in the project and in the Subnet cryptocurrency in compliance with nation states security laws. A portion of Subnet company funds will be used to subsidize early adoption by offering a free service for the first 1,000 users.

## Project Budget
We estimate Subnet will take 3 years to build the first version of the platform with a budget of $10M USD where the vast majority of the budget will go to pay core developers salaries and a minor part for platform marketing in the form of subsidies for early adopters of the platform (users and service providers).

## Subnet Tokenomics
Entities and organizations that would like to become Service Providers on the Subnet network and run Subnet blockchain nodes, need to get $SUB coins and create bonds in order to participate in the platform's blockchain consensus mechanisms and to get rewarded by the protocol. They will need to get the coins by equity investing in the development company.

### SUB Coins ($SUB)
- Total supply: 100,000,000 Coins.
- The coin is created on the public launch of the Subnet public platform which includes the Subnet blockchain.
- Pre-minted: 25,000,000 coins (25% of supply) - allocated for platform development, grants and DOA members.
- Platform rewards: 75,000,000 coins (75% of supply). Coins will be minted as mining and validators rewards over 20 years from platform launch to entities which run service providers nodes and Subnet blockchain nodes.

### Subnet Stable Coin ($SSC)
Subnet plans to issue a fully collateralized stable coin that will be issued as a token over the core SUB coin. The protocol will compensate collators with SUB coins as an interest on their staked funds.
