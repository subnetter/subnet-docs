> This feature is inspired by [Balaji's](https://balajis.com/) concept of `crypto-email` and the notion of the value of people's `attention` resource.

Email is being unbundled by narrow apps that handle specific use cases and can be considered today `my todo list that others have write permission to`. Nobody really feels good about spending time cleaning up their inbox.

This feature enable users who highly-value their time to receive messages from people they don't know who are willing to pay for the users' attention. For people that users do know - Subnet provides the messaging feature.

Users should be able to specify a price in coins for opening a message sent by another user or entity on the Subnet network.

Users should be able to send a message to the priority inbox of another user by paying at least the specified price per message.

Users should be able to pay another's user inbox price and send a message that will be received in the recipient user's inbox.

Recipients should be paid for the amount the sender specified (at least the price per message they ) when they open and view a message in their priority inbox.

> All the goals of the user-to-user messaging are also applicable here as the messages are similar in both cases.
