## Payments Design Goals
1. Support the platform's service providers business model.
1. Avoid having to use complicated L2 payment network technology, and a decentralized stable coin. Integrate them when they are mature enough for production.
1. Create a secure billing and payment architecture with a small number of reoccurring blockchain transactions per user.
1. Consider likely high-volatility in core cryptocurrency fiat prices.
1. Design a blockchain to support user-to-user payments at scale.
1. Support a fixed-monthly-fee service providers business model.
