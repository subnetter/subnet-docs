## The Subnet Dao
Subnet is currently funded and built by `Subnet Dao`, a decentralized annoymous organization. The organization members are currently annoymous software designers and developers from around the world. Current members chose to remain annoymous for the time being, so the project focus will be about the platform, the technology, and the community and not about founders personalities or past accomplishments.

## Why are we anonymous?
We decided we want the project to be about the product, the tech and the community and not about the ego of the founders.

## How do I know this is real?
The progress on the project designs and software already demonstrate a multi-year investment by the founders in the project. The team posting a weekly update of progress on the project that can be independently verified as all Subnet designs, concepts and code are 100% open source.

## Project Funding
Subnet is an ambitious complex software project which requires to be specialized strong developers. The project is currently self-funded by the Subnet DAO. Future development may be additionally funded by sale of $UNT tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Each $SNT token is going to be convertible to one Subnet Coin ($SNP) when the project first network launches from a pool of pre-minted $SNP tokens on the Subnet main ledger.

:::info
No public sale is planned for $UNT tokens. We actively explore ways for different kinds of investors, small and large, to be able to legally invest in the project and in the Subnet cryptocurrency in compliance with national security laws.
:::

Entities and organizations that would like to become Service Providers on the Subnet network will need to purchase $SNP tokens to create bonds in order to participate in the platform's blockchain consensus mechanisms and to get rewarded by the protocol.

> A portion of funds will be used to subsdise early adoption by offering a free service for the first 1000 users.
