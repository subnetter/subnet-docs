As most data is stored in the client and not in service providers, the migration process is relatively straight forward. User signs up to receive service from a new service provider and that provider publishes a new user identity bundle to the Subnet blockchain. User's old providers answers user service related network requests with a response that indicates that the user is no longer serviced by the provider. When another client or service provider receives this message, it should check the Subnet blockchain for the new user's provider bundle and start using this provider to communicate with the user."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"TODO: add example here.
